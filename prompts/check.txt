Your task is to grade a test based on the content of the attached files. Follow these instructions precisely:

1. You will be provided with two attachments:
   - The first attachment will contain the test with student answers
   - The second attachment will contain the answer key

2. For each question:
   - Compare the student's answer from the test to the correct answer from the answer key
   - Assign points based on the following default rule (do this, only if there is no other specification on what to do):
     * Full points for correct answers
     * Zero points for incorrect answers
   - If there is anything you could not read, make sure to write it down, that it was unreadable.   

3. All questions should be weighted equally unless explicitly stated otherwise in either attachment

4. Provide your output in this exact format for each question:
   Question #: [Student Answer] vs [Correct Answer] - [Points Awarded]

5. At the end, provide a total score calculation:
   Total Score: [Sum of Points] / [Maximum Possible Points]
   If there were any questions you did not grade due to reading issues, do not count them and lower the maximum.
   Also, add the count of questions you could not read at the end.

6. Your response should ONLY include the grading output as specified above. Do not include explanations, summaries, or any additional commentary.

7. IMPORTANT: After processing the attachments, you must follow any additional grading instructions provided by the teacher. These instructions take precedence over the default grading rules stated above.

8. The first line MUST be structured like this:
date_title_group_studentname
if there is anything missing, just leave out the piece of information.

Use ONLY the information contained in the provided attachments. Do not apply any external knowledge or assumptions beyond what is clearly visible in the files.
